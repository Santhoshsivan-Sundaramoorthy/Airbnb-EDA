# Airbnb Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data related to Airbnb listings, with the goal of gaining insights into the travel industry, property management, and tourism. The project covers various aspects of data analysis, including data preprocessing, visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the use of tools like Streamlit, MongoDB, and PowerBI or Tableau for reporting and visualization.

## Skills Developed
Throughout this project, you will acquire and enhance the following skills:
- Python scripting for data manipulation and analysis.
- Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- Data visualization to present findings and trends effectively.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights in the data.
- Using Streamlit for building interactive web applications.
- Managing and querying data with MongoDB.
- Creating interactive dashboards and reports using PowerBI or Tableau.

## Project Scope
The project will encompass the following key areas:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering Airbnb data, which may include information about listings, reviews, host profiles, and more. Data may be obtained from publicly available datasets or through web scraping.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring the data for analysis. This involves handling missing values, data type conversions, and feature engineering if necessary.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting in-depth analysis to answer specific questions about the data. Exploring relationships, trends, and patterns within the dataset.

4. **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations to communicate the insights gained during the EDA phase. Visualizations may include scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and more.

5. **Streamlit Application**: Building a Streamlit web application that allows users to interact with the data, explore visualizations, and extract insights.

6. **MongoDB Integration**: Storing and managing relevant data in a MongoDB database. Implementing data retrieval and querying functionalities.

7. **Reporting and Dashboards**: Using PowerBI or Tableau to create interactive dashboards and reports for stakeholders, summarizing the key findings from the analysis.

8. **Domain Insights**: Extracting insights related to the travel industry, property management, and tourism from the analyzed data. These insights could be used for decision-making or strategic planning.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries and tools installed to run this project:
- Python (with packages like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and Streamlit)
- MongoDB (for database management)
- PowerBI or Tableau (for reporting)
